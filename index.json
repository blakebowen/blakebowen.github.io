The Cellranger pipeline is used to process the raw 10x Genomics Chromium single-cell RNA-seq output into a gene expression matrix.\nSeurat guided clustering tutorial For downstream analysis, the best place to start is the vignettes published by the (Satija Lab)[https://satijalab.org/], the authors of Seurat. These tutorials provide an overview of the methods and can be used as an initial analysis framework that can be modified to analyse new datasets. \\\nHBC Single cell RNA-seq data analysis workshop This workshop made by the Harvard Chan Bioinformatics Core has freely available workshop materials.
